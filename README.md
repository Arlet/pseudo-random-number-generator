# Pseudo Random Number Generator (for small CPUs).

Here's a collection of small, fast but high quality PRNGs.

Right now, the "collection" is rather small, but I'm working on adding more versions later. I'm currently working on a version for AVR, and I'm also planning a version for ARM Cortex M0-M4.
